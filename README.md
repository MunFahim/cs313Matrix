Purpose of Software:
    Software created to see the differences in c / c++ when doing a program that feautres complex data, arrays, and memory
Files: 
* matProgram.cpp - c++ file that features matrix functions and the ability to create multiple matrices
* matrixProgram.c - c file that includes matrix creation along with matrix functions like adding, subtracting, transpose, and etc..

Build Instructions: 
* matProgram.cpp file - g++ matProgram.cpp -o yourDesiredExeName
* matrixProgram.c file - gcc -std=c99 -m32 -O0 matrixProgram.c -o yourDesiredExeName

Testing Methodology: 
    Used various examples, including the example from the homework problem and examples from my own linear algebra class. Also, tried many different combinations of adding/multiplying/subtracting/transpoing
